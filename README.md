Spellcheck?

Python setup

See if there is way to just copy entire buffer into the clipboard (in addition to the <C-a> map)

Figure out how to do a default mapping, then override it when using specific lsps/plugins

For markdown files, see if I can create an abbreviation or something that gets updated every time the file is closed/saved/whatever that will auto-gen a table of contents

icons for tree

For haskell: the shift-k doesnt work for locally defined functions (maybe need local hoogle?)

Add commands that will build, run, and build+run the current haskell project

what is project wide go to definition?
