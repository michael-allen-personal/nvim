# NeoVIM Config Folder
## TODO

Python setup

For markdown files, see if I can create an abbreviation or something that gets updated every time the file is closed/saved/whatever that will auto-gen a table of contents

Look into [obsidian.nvim](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim) plugin configuration

Consider moving the "get project exe name" function to ft_helpers, its currently commented out in rust.lua

Add something for fixing indentation of comments on format. Lets make it pretty :)

Look into completion options, currently haskell-tools is different than the config I have in lsp.lua, see which one I like more and use it for both

Look into these suggestions for switching windows: https://neovim.io/doc/user/nvim_terminal_emulator.html#terminal-input

Maybe add commands for insert mode to move right/left, so i can move past autocomplete stuff without using the arrow keys

See this thread about haskell lint: https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/17m6ord/thoughts_on_eta_reduction/

For obsidian, see if there is a good way to quickly import a template into a file in nvim

Look into how I could use the surround plugin to do bold/italics surround in .md files

Spellcheck suggestion menu like autocomplete?

Annoying behavior for Obsidian note references, its leaving weird artifacts behind after suggesting, and the second letter is always being replaced for some weird reason and I have to go back and fix it every time
