## TODO

Python setup

For markdown files, see if I can create an abbreviation or something that gets updated every time the file is closed/saved/whatever that will auto-gen a table of contents

Look into [obsidian.nvim](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim) plugin configuration

Consider moving the "get project exe name" function to ft_helpers, its currently commented out in rust.lua

Add something for fixing indentation of comments on format. Lets make it pretty :)

Look into completion options, currently haskell-tools is different than the config I have in lsp.lua, see which one I like more and use it for both

Look into these suggestions for switching windows: https://neovim.io/doc/user/nvim_terminal_emulator.html#terminal-input

Maybe add commands for insert mode to move right/left, so i can move past autocomplete stuff without using the arrow keys
