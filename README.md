# NeoVIM Config Folder
## TODO

Python setup

For markdown files, see if I can create an abbreviation or something that gets updated every time the file is closed/saved/whatever that will auto-gen a table of contents

Look into [obsidian.nvim](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim) plugin configuration

Add something for fixing indentation of comments on format. Lets make it pretty :)

Look into completion options, currently haskell-tools is different than the config I have in lsp.lua, see which one I like more and use it for both.

Look into [these suggestions](https://neovim.io/doc/user/nvim_terminal_emulator.html#terminal-input) for switching windows: 

See [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/17m6ord/thoughts_on_eta_reduction/) about haskell lint: 

For obsidian, see if there is a good way to quickly import a template into a file in nvim

Look into how I could use the surround plugin to do bold/italics surround in .md files

Spellcheck suggestion menu like autocomplete?

Annoying behavior for Obsidian note references, its leaving weird artifacts behind after suggesting, and the second letter is always being replaced for some weird reason and I have to go back and fix it every time

Abbreviations for contractions?

rust-tools autocomplete behavior is somewhat annoying in how it autofocuses sometimes. I prefer the behavior where I have to do <C-N> to go to the first suggestion instead of it automatically being highlighted

check out [this plugin](https://github.com/ggandor/leap.nvim) for quick moving around

revisit and see if there is anything more I need to do for the ansible and bash lsps

get the variable night light themes working
